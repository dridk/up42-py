We use Facebook Pixels to analyze the general use of our website and to track the effectiveness of Facebook advertising (“conversion”).

This involves deploying offers for certain target groups based on a selection of general criteria, e.g. demographic characteristics, regions or interests. Twitter also allows us to display targeted ads based on a user’s previous page views. For example, ads about our services can be shown to the respective user if that user has previously been interested in certain information or offers on our website. Twitter is certified under the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TORzAAO&amp;status=Active">EU-US Privacy Shield</a> and is thus committed to complying with European data protection regulations.
